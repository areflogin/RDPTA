This code implements a simple multi-class perceptron (RDPTA) for five linearly separable classes in 2D. The user selects training points for each class using mouse clicks. Inputs are augmented with a bias term, and target labels are encoded for all classes. The perceptron updates weights using the delta rule with a sign activation function. After training, the separating lines for each class are plotted, and the error over iterations is shown in a separate figure to visualize convergence.
